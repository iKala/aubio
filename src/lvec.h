  Vector of real-valued data in double precision

  This file specifies the ::lvec_t buffer type, which is used in some places in
  aubio to store a vector of ::lsmp_t.

  Note: the lvec_t data type is required in some algorithms such as IIR filters
  (see temporal/filter.h).

  \example test-lvec.c
